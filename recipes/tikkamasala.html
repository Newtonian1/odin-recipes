    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
        Tikka Masala is an Indian curry consisting of pieces of chicken cooked in a spiced tomato-based sauce. Although it can be served on any kind of rice, typically Basmati rice is the default rice to accompany the curry. For our benefit, we will be using a base sauce to get us started and make the process easier.
